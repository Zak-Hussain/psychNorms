The metabase is the result of a systematic literature search for psychological word norms, in which 3056 articles containing relevant keywords were screened
(see section 'psychNorms' in the paper for more details). Following several rounds of screening, the results were combined with various psycholocal norms from the 
South Carolina Psycholinguistic Metabases ([SCOPE](https://www.sc.edu/study/colleges_schools/artsandsciences/psychology/research_clinical_facilities/scope/)) and 
a [dataset](https://doi.org/10.1080/02643294.2016.1147426) of 65 human-rated experiential attributes resulting in a metabase of XX psychological word norms.

The metabase is composed of two files:
- `psychNorms.csv.zip`: Contains XX psychological norms (columns) at the word level (rows).
- `psychNorms_metadata.csv`: Contains metadata for each of the norms in `psychNorms.csv`.

Norms with title cased names are norms that also exist in SCOPE or the experiential attributes dataset. The remaining norms are uniquely derived from the systematic literature search.
